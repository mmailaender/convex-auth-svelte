# Production

Once you have tested that your auth implementation works well with your dev
deployment, you can move onto deploying your app to prod.

<Steps>
### Deploy your app to production

Follow the typical steps for
[deploying a Convex app to prod](https://docs.convex.dev/production).

### Configure your environment variables

Now that you have a production deployment, you can configure environment
variables on it.

For the minimal set of required variables, you can use the initialization
command with the `--prod` flag:

```sh
npx @convex-dev/auth --prod
```

Assuming you run this from your project directory and your prod deployment is in
the same project as your dev deployment. If this doesn't work, follow the first
two steps from [Manual Setup](/setup/manual).

### Configure your provider environment variables

Next you must configure the environment variables for each authentication
method.

See [specific guidance for OAuth](/config/oauth#production-setup).

</Steps>
