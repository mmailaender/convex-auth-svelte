# Debugging

## Clearing state

If you're seeing unexpected behavior, the first thing to try clearing local
storage, cookies (if using Next.js), and secure storage (if using React Native),
or running in an incognito window which does not have the same cookies or local
storage, and seeing if the issue persists.

The relevant keys are prefixed with `__convexAuth` (or `__Host-convexAuth` for
Next.js).

## Enabling verbose logging

Having more logs can help you spot potential issues, and understand what's
going. They're also very helpful to include when asking for help or filing
issues.

### Client

You can enable verbose logging on the client when you instantiate the
`ConvexReactClient`

```ts
const client = new ConvexReactClient(process.env.CONVEX_URL, {
  verbose: true,
});
```

Logs will appear in the browser console when you run your app.

### Convex functions

You can enable verbose logging in your Convex functions by setting the
`AUTH_LOG_LEVEL` to `DEBUG` in the Convex dashboard or via the command line:

```sh
npx convex env set AUTH_LOG_LEVEL DEBUG
```

Logs will appear in the Convex dashboard.

Note that this will log tokens and other sensitive information, so this should
only be used when debugging.

### Next.js middleware

Enable verbose logging by passing `verbose: true` to the
`convexAuthNextjsMiddleware` function:

```ts
export default convexAuthNextjsMiddleware(optionalHandler, {
  verbose: true,
});
```

Logs will appear in your `next dev` terminal, or wherever you're running
Next.js.
