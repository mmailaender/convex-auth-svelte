### What are the known issues?

See [issues on Github](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-auth/issues).

## Why should I use Convex Auth instead of NextAuth?

- NextAuth (Auth.js) requires a Next.js (or similar) server. Convex Auth works
  with and without a Next.js server, you can use it directly from an SPA hosted
  on a CDN.
- Convex Auth by running directly and only on your Convex backend avoids some of
  the complexity of syncing state between two servers.
- Convex Auth has built-in support for OTP and email+passwords methods

## Why should I use Convex Auth instead of Clerk or Auth0?

- Convex Auth doesnâ€™t require signing up for another service, except for:
  - Email provider for email-based authentication methods
  - OAuth providers like Google or Github, but you would have to set these up
    with Clerk/Auth0 later anyway
- Convex Auth is simpler because it stores all user data directly in your Convex
  database. It doesn't require syncing state from an external database.
- Convex Auth doesn't require owning a top-level domain (like `example.com`),
  although your email provider or OAuth provider might.
- We still recommend Clerk and Auth0 as featureful auth solutions.

## Why should I use Convex Auth instead of Firebase Auth or Supabase Auth?

- Firebase and Supabase Auth store user data in their respective databases.
  Convex Auth stores user data directly in your Convex database.
- Convex Auth includes basic functionality included in Firebase/Supabase Auth.
  For advanced authentication functionality (SSO, MFA, etc.) we recommend using
  Clerk or Auth0.

## Why should I use Convex Auth instead of Lucia?

- Lucia is oriented towards traditional servers that host a website.
- The previous Convex+Lucia integrations are now deprecated.

## Can I use Convex Auth if I'm not using React?

We currently only have Convex Auth client libraries for React. Contributions to
add a client implementation for another framework are welcome!
